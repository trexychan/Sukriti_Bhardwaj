			<h4>Railway Management System</h4>

			<p>This a real-time animated railway management program to find the optimal railway routes and keep track of 50+ incoming and outgoing passengers. Also, the seating of the train was visible and all the taken seats were coloured red. There was also a meal plan and the user was given a wide range of options. Another additional feature was weather detection - the program gave the temperature at each of the stations. This project made use of python- pyowm for weather detection and tkinter for setting up the GUI. An image of booking seats is shown above. The rest of the code and images can be found on my github!</p>

  			<p>Welcome to Photon Supermarket! This project is a replica of a supermarket-just an online version. This market has different sections such as a grocery section, cosmetics section and so on where the user could see the available options and their respective prices. The user had a shopping cart where the items he wishes to be purchased could be added. For the products the user intended to buy later, a wish list was present which could be accessed by the user anytime. The user could check out his shopping cart and would get a receipt with a unique code number. This project was completely based on python. We imported several API's and used several fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. The image above shows a snip of code when the program is run on the terminal. </p>

  		This project was based on the creation of a web application that converted a given line to its appropriate image. This was achieved by making use of the cortical API which helped in the extraction of keywords from a sentence. Using web scraping, all the possible combinations of the images linked to the various keywords were extracted and the best images which were chosen. The backend development for this project was achieved through nodejs.We are still working on this project.

  		We ideated this project in a hackathon and it won the award of "greatest social impact". We came up with an idea to use Google's AI vision kit to detect unnecessary usage of electricity such as plugged in televisions, mixers and so on. We then made a demo code in python using google's AI vision kit api. We came up with design for sockets which could be used to save electricity.We also found stakeholders, products we could team up with and possible target market as shown above.
