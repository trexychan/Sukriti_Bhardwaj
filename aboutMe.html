	<h1>My hobbies and interests</h1>
	<p>I think I am a person with varying interests. I have tried out several extra-curricular activities throughout my life - swimming, Kathak (a traditional indian dance form ), drawing, painting, vocal music, soccer, basketball, public speaking and karate. It's almost like you name something and I have done it.  </p>
	<br>
	<p>I did not turn out to be a master in all these activities but I got a black belt in karate (helps when I fight with my younger sister who is way stronger than me) and also represented my school in several competitions and even different countries!One activity I particularly enjoyed though, was public speaking. I was a part of my school's debate team and I loved researching the issue, learning about both the sides of the coin and putting your arguments in the right words.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Apart from these activities, I am also involved in volunteering and social sevice. I am in college currently and I am a part of this non-profit called epic intentions. Here, we take a project from some struggling company or individual and solve there problem for free! We are currently working on making a website and data for an organization and I love learning new things and knowing I can make a change.I am also involved in girls who code- we are an organization who teach middle school and high school kids basic concepts of coding. We also hold several events across campus trying to spread the what this field has to offer.</p>
	<br>
	<p> One of my biggest passion is TRAVELLING. I was born in India but brought up in the gulf - Qatar, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. I am currently doing my undergrad in the United States and I went to Europe this summer! I basically was fortunate enough to live and experience the beauty of different cultures.I love taking pictures and I would like to give you a glimpse of the places I have been to!</p>
